While this gives us greater control over which images can and cannot be used in our environments, it poses a bigger problem. How can we leverage container images that are managed in the public cloud?
A common solution to this problem is to sync the public container image to your organization&amp;rsquo;s private registry by pulling down the image and then pushing it to your internal registry.</description></item></channel></rss>
